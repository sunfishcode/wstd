    /// combination with channels, as it allows (long-lived) futures to be
    /// cancelled based on some external event.

    /// When a timeout is returned, the future will be dropped and destructors
    /// will be run.

    /// # Example
    ///
    /// ```no_run
    /// use wstd::prelude::*;
    /// use wstd::time::{Instant, Duration};
    /// use std::io;
    ///
    /// #[wstd::main]
